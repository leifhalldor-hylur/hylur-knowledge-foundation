## 📊 Expected Costs (Monthly)

### Development/Testing
- Cloud Run: ~$0-5 (pay per request)
- Cloud SQL (db-f1-micro): ~$7-10
- Storage: ~$1-2
- **Total: ~$8-17/month**

### Production (with traffic)
- Cloud Run: ~$10-50 (depending on usage)
- Cloud SQL (upgraded): ~$25-100
- Storage: ~$5-15
- **Total: ~$40-165/month**

## 🔒 Security Features

- All secrets stored in Google Secret Manager
- HTTPS enforced with automatic SSL certificates
- Database connections encrypted
- Service accounts with minimal permissions
- Container scanning enabled

## 🚦 Deployment Process

1. **GitHub Repository**: Code pushed to public repository
2. **Google Cloud Project**: New project created with required APIs
3. **Database Setup**: PostgreSQL instance with secure credentials
4. **Secret Management**: Environment variables stored securely
5. **Container Build**: Docker image built and stored
6. **Database Migration**: Schema applied and data seeded
7. **Service Deployment**: Application deployed to Cloud Run
8. **Domain Mapping**: Custom domain configured
9. **DNS Configuration**: Records provided for domain setup

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

gcloud run services logs read hylur-knowledge-foundation --region=us-central1

# Check service status
gcloud run services describe hylur-knowledge-foundation --region=us-central1
```

### Updates
- Push changes to main/master branch
- GitHub Actions automatically deploys updates
- Zero-downtime deployments

### Scaling
```bash
# Adjust instance limits
gcloud run services update hylur-knowledge-foundation \
  --region=us-central1 \
  --min-instances=1 \
  --max-instances=10
```

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Cloud Build logs in Google Cloud Console
2. Verify all secrets are properly configured
3. Ensure DNS records are correctly set
4. Allow time for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

## 🎉 Success Criteria
